    ArrayList:
    ---------
    1.default capacity = 10
    2.internal data structure:array
    3.leads to memory wastage
    4. insertion: at only rear end it is best.o(n).
    5. best for accessing the data O(1).
    6.takes less space to srore the data
    7.less methods compared to linkedlist
    8.three constructors
    
    LinkedList:
    -----------
     1.default capacity = 10
     2.internal data structure:doubly linked list
     3.no memory wastage
     4.inserting: at te rare end and also at any random location and also at the starting
     5. not best for accessing the data .o(n).
     6. takes more space to store the data
     7.more methods compared to arraylist
     8.two constructors
     
     //assignment :differencce between array and linkedlist
